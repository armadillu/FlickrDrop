# FlickrDrop

Quick and dirty app to upload pics to flickr and put them in a defined PhotoSet.
To do so, drop the images into the app's icon at startup.

It uses an old version of ObjectiveFlickr framework.

"FlickrTags.txt" should contain any tags you want to use, comma separated.
"FlickrDescription.txt" for description.
"FlickrSet.txt" should contain the setID you want to add the picts to.

The first time you launch it, it will ask to authorize with flickr. 
Should be as easy as following the steps.

Once its authorized, just quit it, and drop images into its icon. Once they are all uploaded, it will quit on its own.

Be aware, no error checking or anything fancy here!
